# Voyage
Bit-level encryption using instance-specific encryption algorithms

## Concept

Voyage's encryption algorithm is based on the idea of generating a one-time encryption algorithm for each instance of encrypting any binary packet rather than using a global, general algorithm dependent on an instance-specific key or key pair.
